        <div class="com-bjq"><p style="text-align: justify;">With the opening of the UN climate conference in Copenhagen, &quot;emission reduction&quot; and &quot;low carbon&quot; have become the hottest words in international public opinion recently.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although there is no consensus in the scientific community on the various causes of climate warming and how much the earth and human beings can bear climate warming; Although before the Copenhagen conference, countries prevaricated on each other&#39;s commitment to emission reduction targets, and pessimists even concluded that &quot;the conference will end in fruitlessness and break up unhappily&quot;, one thing is certain that glaciers in many places, including the north and south poles and the three poles of the earth, the Himalayas, are quietly melting, and preventing global warming has become a consensus of more and more people, Mankind is facing the challenge of survival and development.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, the climate issue is no longer simply a matter of improving the earth&#39;s environment and competing for the right to speak on climate. The game between countries is not a matter of differences in understanding between poor and rich countries, as well as a dispute over the dominance of emission standards in economic and social life, but a competition for the right to future development. Developed countries have completed industrialization and crossed the threshold of high emissions. Because developing countries still need development, it is difficult to change the current situation of energy utilization and the existing economic structure in the short term. This is not only the problem of technology and capital, but also the problem of international division of labor and the threshold of workers&#39; Employment under the trend of globalization. Under the severe situation of carbon emission, who should pay for the warming climate and the worsening environment?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, two sets of data have become the basis for developed and developing countries to formulate their own emission reduction policies. First, the &quot;total annual carbon emissions&quot; of various countries often cited by developed countries in recent years. In this group of data, China is referred to as &quot;the first in the world&quot; (about 6.5 billion tons per year), and the United States ranks second (6 billion tons). Second, the &quot;annual per capita carbon emissions&quot; cited by developing countries. On this list, the United States ranks first, with Japan&#39;s per capita of 12 tons and the average level of EU countries of 9.2 tons, far exceeding China (5 tons per capita) and India (2 tons). Moreover, according to relevant estimates, 80% of the accumulated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere currently originate from developed countries, while China and other developing countries account for only the remaining 20%. It seems obvious who will pay for global warming.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a developing country, China could have learned from the experience of industrial development in advanced countries to avoid the heavy burden of development on the environment and reduce the waste of resources. However, due to the problems of large population, backward technology and shortage of funds, China has embarked on the old road of &quot;giving priority to the development of resource-based and labor-intensive industries&quot;, although it does not completely copy the development model of western industrial powers, However, China&#39;s economy has paid a heavy price of environment and resources in the rapid development of the previous three decades. Facing this situation, China has set off a wave of energy conservation and emission reduction. As a responsible big country, China, proceeding from the needs of mitigation and adaptation to climate change, has actively promoted international cooperation in addressing climate change and the establishment and implementation of domestic policy system. At the international level, China ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change in 1992 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, setting an example for developing countries. In order to effectively fulfill its commitments to the Convention, China established the National Coordination Group on climate change Countermeasures in 1998, submitted the initial national communication on climate change of the people&#39;s Republic of China in 2004, and established the National Leading Group on climate change in 2007, headed by the general manager of the State Council, which greatly improved the status of the coordination body of the Convention, The institutional reform in 2008 further strengthened the leadership of climate change, increased the number of member units of the national leading group for climate change from 18 to 20, and established the climate change expert committee to improve the scientificity of climate change decision-making.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, China has formed a relatively perfect policy system to deal with climate change. In June 2007, the Chinese government issued China&#39;s national plan for climate change, which comprehensively elaborated China&#39;s Countermeasures to deal with climate change before 2010. This is not only China&#39;s first comprehensive policy document to deal with climate change, but also the first national plan of developing countries in this field. In October 2008, the white paper &quot;China&#39;s policies and actions to deal with climate change&quot; was released, which comprehensively introduced the impact of climate change on China, China&#39;s policies and actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as well as China&#39;s institutional and mechanism construction, and became a programmatic document for China to deal with climate change.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In early 2008, China&#39;s Ministry of construction and the World Wide Fund for nature jointly launched the &quot;low-carbon city&quot; in mainland China with Shanghai and Baoding as pilot cities. The &quot;low-carbon city&quot; has become the hottest target of mainland cities after the &quot;garden city&quot;, &quot;humanistic city&quot;, &quot;charming city&quot; and &quot;most competitive city&quot;. At the same time, in the context of the intensification of the global financial crisis and the slowdown of economic growth, promoting the development of green industries from the perspective of low-carbon economy can also be used as a means to stimulate the economy. The Chinese government&#39;s investment in response to the crisis has made it clear to promote industrial upgrading and integration, improve energy efficiency and sustainable development. Local governments need to find new economic growth points in the crisis. The development of &quot;low-carbon cities&quot; is basically consistent with the requirements of adjusting the industrial structure. It is believed that the exploration of &quot;low-carbon city&quot; will play a role in the process of urbanization in China.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For example, in cities with plenty of sunshine all year round, we should vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization of solar energy, including the thermal utilization and photovoltaic utilization of solar energy, which have become an important way of energy conservation and emission reduction. Especially for China, as the world&#39;s largest country in the manufacturing and utilization of solar energy application products, the use of solar energy not only saves a lot of economic costs, but also does not produce any pollution. Solar energy is more and more favored by people.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, solar energy application products have attracted more and more attention, and China&#39;s solar energy enterprises have also carried out a lot of research. For example, Hangzhou Weisheng Technology Co., Ltd. has been committed to the research of solar energy application products. At present, it has successfully promoted solar energy monitoring system, solar controller, solar inverter, solar warning lamp and other application products throughout the country, Known as &quot;solar energy application product expert&quot;. I believe that with the support of the government and the cooperation of enterprises, there will be more and more low-carbon cities in China, and China&#39;s road of energy conservation and emission reduction will be wider and wider.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to achieve China&#39;s energy conservation and emission reduction goals, it is a shortcut to vigorously develop and utilize solar clean energy. Hangzhou sole optoelectronics Co., Ltd. will also strive to achieve China&#39;s energy conservation and emission reduction goals, research and develop and produce more solar photovoltaic application products, save municipal electricity, so as to save petroleum energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p><br/></p></div>
